# DESCRIPTION: It's often useful to reference the given module (or class) for
# that matter.
# SOLUTION: Use specific variables/functions to get a reference to the current
# module or class.

__module__
__class__
__function__
__context__

# However, we could add a specific syntax to denote context variables

var m = @module
var c = @class
var f = @function
var c = @context

# Used within an expression would resolve to the curren module, and not be
# identified as a declaration. But is seems a bit shady -- so maybe the
# above globals are better.
